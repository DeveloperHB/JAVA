    <div>1 We are aiming to reduce 50% of our combined absolute Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute greenhouse gas emissions when compared to a 2019 base year, and planning to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.
        2 Carbon-free energy is any type of electricity generation that doesn’t directly emit carbon dioxide, including (but not limited to) solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear. Sustainable biomass and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are special cases considered on a case-by-case basis, but are often also considered carbon-free energy sources.
        3 Scope: Annual freshwater replenished at our offices and Google-owned and -operated data centers, excluding seawater and reclaimed wastewater.</p>
